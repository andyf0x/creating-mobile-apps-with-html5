        <h1>10 incredible findings about aliens from 2020</h1>
        <p>Here on the little space rock we call Earth, humans often wonder whether or not we are alone in this
            universe. Though that question was not answered in 2020, many discoveries seemed to increase the prospect of
            extraterrestrial entities existing. Findings on the closest planet to us, in the outer solar system and the
            far beyond seemed to point to the possibility that other worlds could host organisms ranging from bacteria
            to technological beings. Perhaps, new results in the coming year will finally reveal who else might be out
            there.</p>

        <p>The answer to weird signals happening in the universe is never aliens, until maybe it is. Earlier this month,
            researchers announced that they had captured a very mysterious beam of energy in the radio part of the
            electromagnetic spectrum at 980 megahertz, coming from the closest star to our own. Proxima Centauri, which
            is just 4.2 light-years away, hosts one gas giant and one rocky world 17% larger than Earth that happens to
            be in its star's habitable zone, meaning liquid water could exist there. The unexplained signal reportedly
            shifted slightly while it was being observed, in a way that resembled the shift caused by the movement of a
            planet. Researchers are excited but cautious, explaining that they will need to figure out if more mundane
            sources, such as a comet, hydrogen cloud or even human technology, could be mimicking an alien signal, and
            that it will likely take time before they know one way or another if E.T. is phoning us.</p>

        <h2>Most aliens are probably dead</h2>

        <p>Where there's life, there's also death. While we like to imagine that our galaxy is teeming with
            technological beings capable of contacting us, the flip side is recognizing that all cultures rise and fall,
            meaning that plenty of cosmic societies likely bit the dust long ago. A model released in December put some
            numbers to these truths, taking into account such things as the prevalence of sun-like stars hosting
            Earth-like planets; the frequency of deadly, radiation-blasting supernovas; the time necessary for
            intelligent life to evolve if conditions are right; and the possible tendency of tool-bearing beings to
            destroy themselves. The analysis found that the highest probability of life emerging in the Milky Way likely
            happened around 5.5 billion years ago, before our planet even formed, suggesting that humanity is a relative
            latecomer to the galaxy and that plenty of our potential otherworldly partners are no longer around to talk
            to us.</p>

        <p>The human brain has plenty of constraints. We are misled by cognitive biases, optical illusions and
            inattentional blindness to things we don't expect to see. One question that has always dogged research into
            alien creatures is whether or not we could recognize life that is so different from what we encounter here
            on Earth. Scholars have long urged us to expect the unexpected, trying not to let theory too heavily
            influence what we count as significant. Life on other planets might not leave the same biological signatures
            as terrestrial organisms, making them difficult to spot from our vantage point. And, as Claire Webb, an
            anthropology and history of science student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Live Science
            in January, we must train ourselves to "make the familiar strange," looking at ourselves through an alien
            lens in an effort to constantly reexamine our own assumptions. That way, we might be able to better
            understand ourselves through the eyes of another and perhaps meet creatures on other worlds on their own
            terms rather than ours.</p>
